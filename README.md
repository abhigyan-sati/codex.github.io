This is a classic Snake Game project developed by Abhigyan Sati using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game allows players to control a snake that moves around the screen and eats food to grow longer. The goal is to eat as much food as possible without hitting the walls or colliding with the snake's own body.
